referencing images:
    since we are in the static folder. If you want to reference an image in css, you'll
    want to take that into account

referencing css file in html:
    for html, it's a bit different from normal. You have to use 'url_for()" with the parameters
    being "url_for('static', filename=<file>)

        -'static' represents the folder name. You don't need to include that when writing
        the path for the filename

        - filename represents the file path
